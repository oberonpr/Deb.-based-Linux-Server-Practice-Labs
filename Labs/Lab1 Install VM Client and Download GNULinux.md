# Lab 1. Install a Virtual Machine client and GNU/Linux.

## Make sure you have the VM Client prepared and the ISO file of desired GNU/Linux Downloaded. Make sure it's (Deb.) based.

#### Start VM Client and install GNU/Linux on two VMs.

Follow the installation process and make sure to:

-Name "main" user for the first VM and "secondary" user on the second VM. Make sure to set an easy-to-remember password.

-For hostname, type your username and add "-debian" example: main-debian, secondary-debian.

-Check desired desktop environment or uncheck if you plan to run headless. For better practice, choose LXQT, Xfce, or Mate.

-After installation, make sure to update your fresh install.

#The update/upgrade command might vary depending on the chosen distribution.

``sudo apt update``

``sudo apt-get update``

``sudo apt upgrade``

``sudo apt-get upgrade``
