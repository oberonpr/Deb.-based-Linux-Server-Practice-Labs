## Deb-based-GNU-Linux-Server-Practice-Labs
# (Deb.) based GNU/Linux Server Practice Labs

- This Lab aims to help new Linux users practice different ways to set up and use Deb. based GNU/Linux for server or personal use.

- This is not an official guide, but it should give you enough practice to feel more comfortable with some of the tools used for Linux servers.

- "Labs" can be done in a different order as long as you complete "Lab 1."

- The GNU/Linux I used to create and test these labs was Debian 11 "Bullseye" with "Mate" as my desktop environment and "Gnome Boxes" for the Virtual Machines. 

- Feel free to use your flavor of both GNU/Linux and VM client; as long as your Linux selection is Deb. based, you should be able to run every Lab.

- This is a rolling project, meaning the number of labs and some of its content might change with time to bring better quality practice.
